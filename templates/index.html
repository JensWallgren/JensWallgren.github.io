            I'm building solutions for a suite of different clients. I work with various technologies - some because I love them, some because they make sense within the context of the client I am working with. C#, Azure, JS, React, Python, SAP, ABAP, UI5 (Fiori), Cordova. I've spent a lot of free time mucking around with C and C++ (although mainly C).

        <p>
            I occasionally act as an architect in projects. I enjoy this too, but I prefer projects where we don't get bogged down in planning and whiteboard sessions. The best work is done when one is allowed to be exploratory. I never act as a project manager. I have some ideas on the subject that I happily talk about, but I have colleagues that are far better at the subject. I currently work at Implema AB - a Swedish IT Consultancy focused on ERP systems and surrounding IT systems.
