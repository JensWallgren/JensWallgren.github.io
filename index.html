        <h1>Jens Wallgren</h1>
        <h3>IT & Programming Consultant</h3>
        <p>
            I'm building various solutions for a suite of different clients. I work with various technologies - some because I love them, some because they make sense within the context of the client I am working with. I build various enterprise software extensions and solutions using C#, Azure, JS, React, Python, SAP, ABAP, UI5 (Fiori), Cordova. I've spent a lot of free time mucking around with C and C++ (although mainly C).

        <h4>Programmer first. Architect second</h4>
        <p>
            I occasionally act as an architect in projects. I enjoy this too, but I prefer projects where we don't get bogged down in planning and whiteboard sessions. The best work is done when one is allowed to be exploratory. I never act as a project manager. I have colleagues that do project management better. I currently work at Implema AB - a Swedish IT Consultancy focused on ERP systems and surrounding IT systems.

        <h4>Views on the industry I'm in</h4>
        <p>
            I think a lot of enterprise software suffers from symptoms of over-engineering and a lack of long-sightedness in what tools will likely be in use 10 years from now. That being said, for a lot of software I am working on, re-architecting or rebuilding things "to remake it right" is not a viable option. WHich means that I'm occasionally building things with technoligies I wouldn't really recommend. Building stuff and shipping software that actually make a difference is what's most important (and what makes work gratifying).
